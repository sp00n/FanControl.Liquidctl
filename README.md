# FanControl.Liquidctl


## Mod by sp00n
I tried to add support for fan controllers that return multiple fan entries (e.g. "Fan 1 speed", "Fan 2 speed", etc), so that controllers like the ones from NZXT are supported.
I probably violated a dozen of best practices for C# in doing so, but it appears to be working for me.



## Original description

This is a simple plugin that uses [liquidctl](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl) to provide sensor data and pump control to variety of AIOs. So far it is tested with NZXT Kraken X63, but in principle shall work with [supported devices](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl#supported-devices)

## Installation

Grab a release and unpack it to `Plugins` directory of your FanControl instalation. It contains Windows bundle of liquidctl.

## Setting up the developer environment

The project, after being imported to Visual Studio needs to have it reference to `FanControl.Plugins.dll` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` from FanControl directory. You also need to create the executable of liquidctl, which can be automatized with script `build-liquidctl.sh`.
